# Consumer-Producer model prototype
Universal Producer-Consumer model implementation. Synchronization of shared memory usage is left to the user of this. 
Using run-time polymorphism this example uses a fake "Mock Engine" to show how to use this to record commands for the Consumer thread to execute in parallel 
or to execute immediatelly on the Producer thread for easier debugging.
